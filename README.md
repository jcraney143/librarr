**The missing *arr for books.** Self-hosted book, audiobook, and manga search and download manager -- like Sonarr/Radarr but for your reading library.

Librarr searches all configured indexers in parallel, scores results by confidence, and auto-imports into your Calibre, Audiobookshelf, Kavita, or Komga library. Single ~17MB Go binary, no runtime dependencies — **~14MB RSS idle** in a real homelab[^1], typically 10-20× lower than the .NET-based *arr apps.

[^1]: Measured on v1.1.0 in an LXC on Debian 12 (Mar 2026). Reference: Sonarr 4.x ≈ 240MB, Radarr 5.x ≈ 220MB on the same host.

## Why Librarr?

- **Import your Goodreads or StoryGraph library** via CSV and bulk-download everything
- **Request workflow** -- users request books, admins approve, downloads happen automatically (like Jellyseerr for books)
- **Quality profiles** -- rank formats (EPUB > PDF > MOBI), auto-upgrade when a better version appears
- **Author monitoring** -- follow authors and get notified when new releases are found
- **Series auto-complete** -- detects gaps in series and searches for missing volumes
- **Torznab API** -- add Librarr as an indexer in Prowlarr or Readarr (it works both ways)
- **OPDS 1.2 feed** -- browse your library from any e-reader app
- **Tiny footprint** -- ~14MB idle RSS, runs comfortably on a Pi or any thermally-constrained mini-PC

## Features

### Search and Scoring

- **Pluggable indexer registry** -- driver kinds listed below; default endpoints are fetched at startup from the `librarr-sources` companion repo and overrideable at runtime via `LIBRARR_SOURCES_URL` / `LIBRARR_SOURCES_PATH`
- **Confidence scoring** -- 0-100 score with breakdown (title match, author match, format, seeders, file size)
- **Quality profiles** -- define format ranking and preferred attributes, auto-upgrade existing downloads
- **Release profiles** -- preferred and excluded words for fine-grained filtering
- **Blocklist** -- failed downloads are auto-blocked to prevent retries; manual entries supported
- **Already-in-library detection** -- results you already own are flagged with `in_library` / `library_item_id` and badged in the UI; matching normalizes punctuation, author prefixes and parenthetical alternate titles, so `Agatha Christie - 4.50 From Paddington` finds `4:50 from Paddington`

### Download Management

- **Multiple download clients** -- qBittorrent or Transmission for torrents, plus SABnzbd for Usenet
- **Anna's Archive membership fast download** -- optional account secret key uses `/dyn/api/fast_download.json`, with LibGen mirror fallback
- **Request/approval workflow** -- pending, approved, searching, downloading, completed states with per-request notifications
- **Scheduled wishlist searches** -- background scheduler auto-searches and downloads wishlist items on a configurable interval
- **Torrent completion watcher** -- polls download client, auto-imports completed downloads
- **Dead letter retry** -- failed jobs can be retried individually or in bulk

### Library Management

- **Auto-import pipeline** -- organize files by author/title, rename on import (configurable pattern), scan into Calibre/Audiobookshelf/Kavita/Komga
- **Series auto-complete** -- detect gaps in series, search for and download missing books
- **Author monitoring** -- follow authors, periodically check for new releases, auto-notify
- **Calendar tab** -- manage tracked authors (add/remove/check now), see a timeline of new releases found, and see series with missing volumes in one place
- **Reading history** -- track what you've read with stats (books per month, pages, completion rate)
- **Tags** -- organize library items with custom tags for filtering and grouping
- **Series grouping** -- groups related books/volumes in the library view
- **EPUB verification** -- checks title word overlap to detect wrong-book downloads

### Notifications and Webhooks

- **In-app notifications** -- persistent alerts for downloads, requests, failures, and author releases
- **Discord webhooks** -- rich embeds for download events, request updates, and errors
- **Generic webhooks** -- JSON payloads for any webhook-compatible service
- **Configurable events** -- choose which events trigger notifications

### Import and Export

- **Goodreads CSV import** -- import your shelves, auto-download "to-read" books
- **StoryGraph CSV import** -- import your reading list
- **Library export** -- JSON and CSV export for library, wishlist, and requests
- **Backup and restore** -- full database backup with one-click restore

### APIs and Integrations

- **Torznab/Newznab API** at `/torznab/api` -- add as indexer in Prowlarr, Readarr, or any compatible app
- **OPDS 1.2 feed** at `/opds` -- browse and download from e-readers (KOReader, Moon+ Reader, Librera)
- **Prometheus metrics** at `/metrics` -- request counts, download stats, source health, library size
- **REST API** -- full JSON API for all operations (see API section below)

### Security and Multi-User

- **Multi-user auth** -- session login with bcrypt passwords and admin/user roles
- **TOTP 2FA** -- RFC 6238 time-based one-time passwords with QR code setup
- **OIDC / SSO** -- OpenID Connect for Authelia, Keycloak, Authentik, and others
- **API key auth** -- `X-Api-Key` header or `?apikey=` parameter for programmatic access
- **Rate limiting** -- per-endpoint rate limits with configurable thresholds
- **Security headers** -- X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CORS, request size limits

### UI and Admin

- **Modern dark UI** -- Tailwind CSS, mobile-responsive, single-page app
- **Admin dashboard** -- library stats, source health, activity log, system info
- **Bulk operations** -- retry or cancel multiple downloads at once
- **File uploads** -- drag and drop ebooks/audiobooks, auto-organize and library scan
- **Connection tests** -- verify Prowlarr, qBittorrent, SABnzbd, Audiobookshelf, Kavita connectivity

### Deployment

- **Single static binary** -- ~17MB, zero CGO, pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`)
- **Docker-ready** -- minimal Alpine image, runs as non-root user
- **Cross-platform** -- Linux, macOS, Windows; amd64, arm64, armv7

## Search Sources

Librarr ships with **driver implementations** -- the protocols it can speak. The list of active indexers, their endpoints, mirrors, and enabled flags lives in a JSON registry, hosted in the [`librarr-sources`](https://github.com/JeremiahM37/librarr-sources) companion repo and fetched at startup (similar to how Prowlarr syncs its indexer definitions). The binary itself ships no embedded registry. After the first successful fetch the registry is cached on disk so subsequent restarts work offline. To use a different registry, set `LIBRARR_SOURCES_URL` (another HTTP source) or `LIBRARR_SOURCES_PATH` (a local file).

| Driver | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| Torznab / Newznab | Prowlarr-managed indexers (any Torznab-compatible source) |
| OPDS 1.2 catalogs | Library, archive, and OPDS-acquisition feeds |
| Public JSON / RSS APIs | Open metadata APIs, public RSS feeds |
| Direct-download with MD5/key lookup | Archive sites that key downloads by content hash |
| Authenticated forum / tracker | Private trackers (user supplies credentials) |
| Library-card-style API | Account-gated catalogs (user supplies endpoint + credentials) |
| Web-novel crawler (`lncrawl`) | Web-novel sites with chapter pagination |
| HTML scrape with regex extractor | Sites without a structured API |

To add or remove a specific indexer endpoint, edit the registry -- no code changes required.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```yaml
services:
  librarr:
    image: ghcr.io/jeremiahm37/librarr:latest
    ports:
      - "5050:5050"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - /path/to/ebooks:/books/ebooks
      - /path/to/audiobooks:/books/audiobooks
      - /path/to/manga:/books/manga
    environment:
      - AUTH_USERNAME=admin
      - AUTH_PASSWORD=changeme
      - API_KEY=your-api-key-here
      - QB_URL=http://qbittorrent:8080
      - QB_USER=admin
      - QB_PASS=changeme
      - PROWLARR_URL=http://prowlarr:9696
      - PROWLARR_API_KEY=your-prowlarr-api-key
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Binary

```bash
# Download from releases
curl -LO https://github.com/JeremiahM37/librarr/releases/latest/download/librarr_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf librarr_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# Configure
export AUTH_USERNAME=admin
export AUTH_PASSWORD=changeme
export QB_URL=http://localhost:8080
# ... set other env vars as needed

# Run
./librarr
```

Open `http://localhost:5050` in your browser.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Every variable has a sensible default.

Service URLs (`ABS_URL`, `PROWLARR_URL`, `KAVITA_URL`, …) may be written with or
without a scheme — `audiobookshelf:13378` is normalized to
`http://audiobookshelf:13378`, and trailing slashes are trimmed. The same applies
to URLs saved from the Settings UI. Use `https://` explicitly when the service is
behind TLS.

### Server

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LIBRARR_PORT` | `5050` | HTTP listen port |
| `LIBRARR_DB_PATH` | `/data/librarr.db` | SQLite database path |
| `SETTINGS_FILE` | `/data/settings.json` | Persistent settings file |

### Authentication

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | | Login username (enables session auth) |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | | Login password |
| `API_KEY` | | API key for programmatic access (`X-Api-Key` header or `?apikey=` param) |

### OIDC / SSO

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable OpenID Connect login |
| `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME` | `SSO` | Button label on login page |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | | OIDC issuer URL |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | | OAuth2 client ID |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | | OAuth2 client secret |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` | | Callback URL (`https://librarr.example.com/auth/oidc/callback`) |
| `OIDC_AUTO_CREATE_USERS` | `true` | Auto-create users on first OIDC login |
| `OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE` | `user` | Default role for OIDC-created users |
| `OIDC_PROXY_HEADERS_ENABLED` | `false` | Trust Authentik identity headers from a reverse proxy |

When `OIDC_PROXY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true` and Librarr sits behind a trusted reverse
proxy that injects Authentik headers like `X-Authentik-Username`, it will treat
those requests as an authenticated SSO session, auto-provision the local user if
needed, and skip the manual "Login with SSO" click. Enable this only for
proxy-gated deployments.
Local logout only clears Librarr's session cookie; if the proxy keeps sending
the identity header, the next request will sign the browser back in.

### Download Clients

Librarr sends torrents to **either qBittorrent or Transmission**. Configure one,
or configure both and choose with `TORRENT_CLIENT`. The category/save-path
settings below apply to both (Transmission uses the category as a torrent label,
which requires Transmission 3.0+).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TORRENT_CLIENT` | | Active torrent backend when both are configured: empty (auto, qBittorrent preferred), `qbittorrent`, or `transmission` |
| `QB_URL` | | qBittorrent Web UI URL |
| `QB_USER` | `admin` | qBittorrent username |
| `QB_PASS` | | qBittorrent password |
| `QB_SAVE_PATH` | `/downloads` | Ebook download path as seen by qBittorrent (the remote/client-side path) |
| `QB_CATEGORY` | `librarr` | Torrent category for ebooks |
| `QB_AUDIOBOOK_SAVE_PATH` | `/audiobooks-incoming` | Audiobook download path |
| `QB_AUDIOBOOK_CATEGORY` | `audiobooks` | Torrent category for audiobooks |
| `QB_MANGA_SAVE_PATH` | `/manga-incoming` | Manga download path |
| `QB_MANGA_CATEGORY` | `manga` | Torrent category for manga |
| `QB_PRIORITY` | `1` | Download client priority (lower = preferred) |
| `REMOVE_TORRENT_AFTER_IMPORT` | `true` | Remove the torrent from the download client after a successful import. **Set it to `false` to keep seeding** — librarr then hardlinks imports instead of moving them, so the payload stays where the client can seed it. See [Seeding after import](#seeding-after-import). |
| `TRANSMISSION_URL` | | Transmission RPC URL (e.g. `http://transmission:9091`) |
| `TRANSMISSION_USER` | | Transmission RPC username (optional — only if RPC auth is enabled) |
| `TRANSMISSION_PASS` | | Transmission RPC password (optional) |
| `SABNZBD_URL` | | SABnzbd URL |
| `SABNZBD_API_KEY` | | SABnzbd API key |
| `SABNZBD_CATEGORY` | `librarr` | NZB download category |
| `SAB_PRIORITY` | `2` | Download client priority |

### Prowlarr

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PROWLARR_URL` | | Prowlarr URL |
| `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | | Prowlarr API key |

### Anna's Archive

> **Search is currently blocked upstream (August 2026).** Anna's Archive sits
> behind DDoS-Guard, which serves an **hCaptcha "I am human" check** on
> `/search` and `/md5/*`. This blocks a real browser, not just scrapers, so the
> `annas` source returns no results and will report itself unhealthy. The cause
> is upstream and legal rather than a librarr bug: after the January 2026
> lawsuit, Cloudflare disabled the nameservers for several AA domains and the
> survivors moved to DDoS-Guard, followed by a global domain takedown order.
>
> What this means in practice:
>
> - **Search: unavailable.** Every surviving domain (`.gl`, `.pk`, `.gd`)
>   behaves the same, and AA publishes no JSON search API — its own API
>   self-documentation (`GET /dyn/api/fast_download.json` with no parameters)
>   lists `fast_download` as the only stable endpoint.
> - **Downloads: still work** with a membership key. `/dyn/api/fast_download.json`
>   is *not* behind the challenge, so `ANNAS_ARCHIVE_SECRET_KEY` below still
>   resolves MD5s to download URLs.
> - **FlareSolverr does not help.** It solves Cloudflare, not DDoS-Guard, and
>   times out on the hCaptcha challenge.
> - `annas-archive.org` and `.se` no longer resolve, and `annas-archive.li` is
>   an unrelated parked domain — do not point `ANNAS_ARCHIVE_DOMAIN` at it.
>
> Other sources (Prowlarr, Gutenberg, Open Library, Standard Ebooks, Z-Library)
> are unaffected.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ANNAS_ARCHIVE_DOMAIN` | (from sources registry) | AA mirror hostname (no scheme) |
| `ANNAS_ARCHIVE_SECRET_KEY` | | Account secret key from the AA login page (also called a donator key in some tools). Used for `/dyn/api/fast_download.json` when the account has an active membership. Env alias `AA_DONATOR_KEY` is still accepted. Without a key, downloads use public LibGen mirrors. |

### Library Imports

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_PATH` | | Path to Calibre library (auto-import via `calibredb`) |
| `CALIBRE_URL` | | Calibre-Web URL |
| `KAVITA_URL` | | Kavita server URL |
| `KAVITA_USER` | | Kavita username |
| `KAVITA_PASS` | | Kavita password |
| `KAVITA_LIBRARY_PATH` | | Kavita ebook library path |
| `KAVITA_MANGA_LIBRARY_PATH` | | Kavita manga library path |
| `KAVITA_EBOOK_LIBRARY_ID` | | Kavita library to scan after an ebook import (blank = all) |
| `KAVITA_MANGA_LIBRARY_ID` | | Kavita library to scan after a manga import (blank = all) |
| `KAVITA_PUBLIC_URL` | | Kavita URL for external links |
| `ABS_URL` | | Audiobookshelf server URL |
| `ABS_TOKEN` | | Audiobookshelf API token |
| `ABS_LIBRARY_ID` | | Audiobookshelf audiobook library ID |

| `KOMGA_PASS` | | Komga password |
| `KOMGA_LIBRARY_ID` | | Komga library ID |
| `KOMGA_LIBRARY_PATH` | | Komga library path |

### File Organization

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FILE_ORG_ENABLED` | `true` | Auto-organize downloaded files |
| `IMPORT_MODE` | (automatic) | How organized files reach the library: `move` (the download payload is consumed), `hardlink` (a second name for the same data — keeps seeding, no extra disk, same filesystem only), or `copy` (keeps seeding, uses twice the disk). Leave it unset and it follows `REMOVE_TORRENT_AFTER_IMPORT`: removing torrents moves, keeping them hardlinks. See [Seeding after import](#seeding-after-import). |
| `EBOOK_DIR` | `/books/ebooks` | Organized ebook destination |
| `AUDIOBOOK_DIR` | `/books/audiobooks` | Organized audiobook destination |
| `MANGA_DIR` | `/books/manga` | Organized manga destination |
| `INCOMING_DIR` | `/data/incoming` | Incoming file staging directory as seen by Librarr; qBittorrent paths beneath `QB_SAVE_PATH` are translated here before import |
| `MANGA_INCOMING_DIR` | `/data/manga-incoming` | Manga incoming staging directory |

#### Seeding after import

**One setting.** For private trackers with seed-time minimums:

```env
REMOVE_TORRENT_AFTER_IMPORT=false
```

Two separate things have to survive an import for a torrent to keep seeding —
its **record** in the client, and its **payload files** where the client wrote
them. Keeping the record is what that setting says; keeping the payload is what
`IMPORT_MODE` controls. Rather than make you set both, librarr infers the second
from the first:

| `REMOVE_TORRENT_AFTER_IMPORT` | `IMPORT_MODE` unset resolves to | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `true` (default) | `move` | Payload goes into the library; nothing is left to seed, and nothing needs to be. Unchanged from earlier releases. |
| `false` | `hardlink` | Payload stays in the download folder, the library gets a second name for the same data, and the torrent keeps seeding. |

Setting `IMPORT_MODE` explicitly always wins over that inference — use it to
force `copy` on a filesystem without hardlinks, or `hardlink` while still
removing torrents. `IMPORT_MODE=move` together with
`REMOVE_TORRENT_AFTER_IMPORT=false` is the one combination that cannot seed;
librarr logs a warning at startup if you configure it.

Notes on the modes:

- **`hardlink`** costs no extra disk — the library entry and the download folder
  are two names for the same data, and the space is reclaimed when both are
  gone. It requires the download folder and the library directories to be on the
  **same filesystem**; in Docker that usually means one volume mounted at a
  common parent (e.g. `/data`) rather than separate `/downloads` and `/books`
  mounts. When a link cannot be created (different filesystem, or a filesystem
  without hardlinks such as CIFS/exFAT), librarr logs a warning and copies
  instead, so the import still lands.
- **`copy`** always works but stores the book twice until you delete the torrent.
  It is also the mode to pick when something else writes to your library files:
  a hardlinked file *is* the seeded data, so a tool that rewrites tags in place
  (some audiobook taggers do) changes the torrent's bytes underneath it and the
  next recheck fails. Tools that write a new file and rename it are safe, as is
  librarr itself — it only ever reads imported files or copies them onward.
- With `hardlink` or `copy`, if you *also* leave `REMOVE_TORRENT_AFTER_IMPORT=true`,
  librarr removes the torrent **and its files** once every file is safely in the
  library — otherwise the payload would sit in the download folder with nothing
  left to clean it up. The library copy is unaffected (a hardlink keeps the data
  alive). If any file failed to organize, the payload is left alone.
- **Seed goals belong to your torrent client, not to librarr.** Once imports
  hardlink, qBittorrent's own share-ratio / seeding-time limits can be set to
  "remove torrent and its files" when the goal is met: the download folder is
  cleaned up on the tracker's schedule and the library keeps the book, because
  the library entry is a link to the same data rather than a second copy.
- File organization must be on (`FILE_ORG_ENABLED=true`) for any of this; with it
  off, librarr indexes files where they already are and never touches them.

**Scope.** `IMPORT_MODE` applies to torrent imports and manual imports — the
cases where the source may be a live torrent payload. Everything else always
moves, because nothing is seeding it and leaving a second copy behind would just
accumulate: SABnzbd/usenet imports (librarr never removes anything from the
completed folder), web UI uploads, and direct HTTP downloads from sources like
Anna's Archive, all of which are librarr's own files.

### Sources Registry

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LIBRARR_SOURCES_URL` | (built-in default points at `librarr-sources`) | URL of a JSON sources registry, fetched at startup |
| `LIBRARR_SOURCES_PATH` | | Local path to a sources registry JSON file; takes precedence over URL |

Resolution order on startup: `LIBRARR_SOURCES_PATH` → `LIBRARR_SOURCES_URL` → built-in default URL → on-disk cache (`<LIBRARR_DB_PATH dir>/sources-cache.json`) → empty registry. Successful URL fetches are cached so subsequent restarts work offline. If you set `LIBRARR_SOURCES_URL`, your value replaces the default — it does not stack on top of it.

Legacy per-source env vars (e.g. `PROWLARR_URL` and other per-driver overrides) continue to be honored and override values loaded from the registry.

### Search / Downloads

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MIN_TORRENT_SIZE_BYTES` | `10000` | Minimum torrent size filter (10 KB) |
| `MAX_TORRENT_SIZE_BYTES` | `2000000000` | Maximum torrent size filter (2 GB) |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | Download retry attempts |
| `RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` | `60` | Seconds between retries |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Failures before disabling a source |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds before re-enabling a tripped source |

### Feature Toggles

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Per-source rate limiting |
| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Prometheus metrics endpoint |
| `WEBNOVEL_ENABLED` | `true` | Web novel search (requires lncrawl container) |
| `WISHLIST_CLEANUP_ENABLED` | `false` | Periodically remove wishlist items already found in the library |
| `WISHLIST_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `12` | Hours between wishlist cleanup scans |
| `WISHLIST_CLEANUP_DRY_RUN` | `true` | Log conservative wishlist cleanup matches without deleting |
| `MANGADEX_ENABLED` | `true` | MangaDex search |
| `AUTHOR_MONITOR_ENABLED` | `false` | Background author monitoring |

## Torznab / Newznab API

Librarr exposes a standard Torznab API at `/torznab/api` that can be added as an indexer in Prowlarr, Readarr, or any Torznab-compatible application.

**Setup in Prowlarr / Readarr:**

1. Go to Settings > Indexers > Add
2. Select "Generic Torznab" (or "Generic Newznab")
3. Set the URL to `http://your-librarr-host:5050/torznab/api`
4. Set the API Key to your `TORZNAB_API_KEY` value
5. Test and save

**Capabilities:** `GET /torznab/api?t=caps` returns the supported search categories and capabilities.

## OPDS Feed

Librarr serves an OPDS 1.2 catalog at `/opds` for e-reader apps (KOReader, Moon+ Reader, Librera, etc.).

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/opds` | Catalog root |
| `/opds/books` | Browse all books |
| `/opds/search?q=` | Search the catalog |
| `/opds/download/{id}` | Download a book file |
| `/opds/opensearch.xml` | OpenSearch descriptor |

**Setup:** Add `http://your-librarr-host:5050/opds` as an OPDS catalog in your e-reader. If auth is enabled, enter your Librarr username and password.

## Using Librarr with Claude / MCP

Librarr's REST API is the integration surface, so any [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server can expose Librarr's search, download, and library tools to an LLM (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Open WebUI, Cursor, etc.). There's no built-in MCP server in Librarr — you wire it into the MCP server you already run.

**Auth:** every endpoint accepts an `X-Api-Key` header or `?apikey=` query param. Set `API_KEY` in your `docker-compose.yml` and reuse it from your MCP server.

**Minimal Python example** using [`fastmcp`](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp):

```python
# librarr_mcp.py — run as: fastmcp run librarr_mcp.py
import os, httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP

LIBRARR = os.environ["LIBRARR_URL"]       # e.g. http://librarr.lan:5050
API_KEY = os.environ["LIBRARR_API_KEY"]
HEADERS = {"X-Api-Key": API_KEY}

mcp = FastMCP("librarr")

@mcp.tool()
async def search_books(query: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Search for an ebook across all configured sources."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as c:
        r = await c.get(f"{LIBRARR}/api/search", params={"q": query}, headers=HEADERS)
        return r.json()

@mcp.tool()
async def download_book(result: dict) -> dict:
    """Queue an ebook download. Pass a result object returned by search_books — it
    already contains `source`, `title`, and the source-specific URL field
    (`download_url` / `magnet_url` / `md5` / etc.)."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as c:
        r = await c.post(f"{LIBRARR}/api/download", json=result, headers=HEADERS)
        return r.json()

@mcp.tool()
async def list_downloads() -> list[dict]:
    """List active and recent download jobs with status."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as c:
        r = await c.get(f"{LIBRARR}/api/downloads", headers=HEADERS)
        return r.json()
```

**Register with Claude Desktop / Claude Code** (`~/.claude.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "librarr": {
      "command": "fastmcp",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/librarr_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "LIBRARR_URL": "http://librarr.lan:5050",
        "LIBRARR_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The same pattern works for audiobooks (`/api/search/audiobooks`, `/api/download/audiobook`) and manga (`/api/search/manga`, `/api/download/torrent`). Wrap whichever subset of the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) above is useful to your assistant.
